//! The two sources of a typed DMA address (`docs/hardware-memory.md`).

//! The PAC's [`DmaWindowAddress`] and [`DmaRef`] constructors are `unsafe`

//! ([`crate::dma_static`]), a descriptor table, a buffer arena or a placed
//! pool's buffer that stays pinned while the hardware may read it.
//!
//! A buffer lent to the hardware from outside the placed storage (a network
//! stack's or a PSRAM buffer) has no source yet: it returns as a loan type,
//! checked in the window where the loan is made, with the first such buffer.
